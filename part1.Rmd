# Package development with R-hub

Learn how to create R packages, how write R package documentation
(using `roxygen2`), how to write unit tests (with `testthat`).

Learn how to check your package, locally, and on multiple platforms,
using R-hub.

R-hub is a project by the R Consortium.

# Outline

* Creating R packages

* `R CMD check`

* Finding and reading R code

* Writing documentation

* `rhub::check()`

* Writing test cases
























<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

# Why create a R package

* Encapsulation: move code (+ data?) around
* Sharing code (+ data?)
* Distributing code (+ data?)
* Testing code
* Documenting code (+ data?)
* Versioning code




# How to create an R package

1. RStudio IDE

2. `devtools` package

    ```
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::create()
    ```

# Stages of the life of an R package

1. Package directory
2. `R CMD build`: Source R package (`mypackage_1.0.0.tar.gz`)
3. `R CMD INSTALL`: Installed R package
4. `library(mypackage)`: loaded R package
5. Calling an R package: `mypackage::myfunction()`

We will now use `devtools`, because it allows us to `build`, `install`,
etc. from within R:

1. Package directory
2. `devtools::build()`: Source R package (`mypackage_1.0.0.tar.gz`)
3. `devtools::install()`: Installed R package, in a package library
4. `library(mypackage)`: loaded & attached R package
5. Calling an R package: `mypackage::myfunction()`

While we are developing the package, we can just use
`devtools::load_all()`, which pretends that the package is built,
installed, loaded and attached.

Tricky question. When is the code in the R package (i.e. in the `R`
directory) evaluated? At build time? At install time? At loading time?
At calling time?

If you don't know, how would you find out?



print("foo")

f <- function() {

}


# Checking an R package

`devtools::check` runs `R CMD check`, which performs many syntactic
checks on your package.







# Exercise

Create a package that randomly praises the user. I.e. something like this:

```
❯ praise::praise()
[1] "You are remarkable!"

❯ praise::praise()
[1] "You are transcendent!"

❯ praise::praise()
[1] "You are terrific!"
```

Run `devtools::check` on your package. Interpret the result.
